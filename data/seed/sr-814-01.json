Soil means the unsealed top layer of land where plants may grow. 5 Substances are natural or manufactured chemical elements and their compounds. Preparations (mixtures, blends and solutions) and articles containing such substances are also regarded as substances. 5bis Organisms are any cellular or non-cellular biological entity capable of replication or of transferring genetic material. Mixtures and articles containing such entities are also regarded as organisms. 5ter Genetically modified organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been changed in a way that does not occur under natural conditions by crossbreeding or natural recombination. 5quater Pathogenic organisms are organisms that can cause disease. 6 Waste is any moveable material disposed of by its holder or the disposal of which is required in the public interest. 6bis Disposal of waste includes its recovery or deposit in a landfill as well as the preliminary stages of collection, transport, storage and treatment. «Treatment» is any physical, chemical or biological modification of the waste. 6ter Handling means any activity in connection with substances, organisms or waste, and in particular their manufacture, import, export, putting in circulation, use, storage, transport or disposal. 7 Installations are buildings, traffic routes and other fixed facilities as well as modifications of the terrain. Appliances, machines, vehicles, ships and aircraft are also regarded as installations. 8 Environmental information is information in the fields addressed by this Act and in the fields addressed by legislation on the protection of nature and cultural heritage, landscape protection, waters protection, protection against natural hazards, forest conservation, hunting, fishing, gene technology and climate protection. 9 Biogenic motor and thermal fuels are liquid or gaseous motor and thermal fuels that are produced from biomass or other renewable energy sources.

The maximum rates of the charge are as follows: a. for waste deposited in Switzerland: 1. in the case of landfills for non-contaminated or lightly contaminated waste: CHF 8/t, 2. in the case of other landfills: CHF 25/t; b. for waste deposited abroad: 1. in the case of underground landfills; CHF 30/t, 2. in the case of other landfills: as much as it would cost to deposit the waste in a landfill in Switzerland. 2bis The Federal Council may adjust the rate of the charge under paragraph 2 in line with Swiss Consumer Price Index. 3 The Confederation uses the income from the charges exclusively to pay the costs of the following measures: a. the provision of a register of polluted sites, provided their proprietors have been given the opportunity by 1 November 2007 to state their opinion on inclusion in the register; b. the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites in which no waste has been deposited since 1 February 2001 if: 1. the person responsible cannot be identified or is unable to pay, or 2. a significant proportion of the waste deposited on the site is municipal waste; c. the investigation, monitoring and remediation of polluted sites at shooting ranges that do not serve a predominantly commercial purpose if: 1. on sites in groundwater protection zones, no further waste has been deposited after 31 December 2012, 2. on other sites, no further waste has been deposited after 31 December 2020 or only the waste from historical shooting events or field shooting events that are held no more than once per year and that had already been held regularly at the same location before 31 December 2020; c bis . adequate protection measures, such as the use of butts, are taken at historical shooting events or field shooting events that are held no more than once per year and that had already been held regularly at the same location before 31 December 2020; d. the investigation of sites that are not found to be polluted (Art. 32 d para. 5). 4 The payments are made only if the measures taken are environmentally compatible and cost-effective and correspond to the state of the art.

      "content": "1 Persons subject to an authorisation or notification obligation who handle pathogenic organisms in a contained system, release such organisms for experimental purposes or put them into circulation without authorisation are liable for any loss or damage that arises from such conduct. 2 The person required to obtain authorisation is exclusively liable for any loss or damage occasioned to an agricultural or forestry establishment or customers of products from such establishments by pathogenic organisms that are authorised to be put into circulation if the organisms: a. are contained in auxiliary agents used in agriculture or forestry; or b. originate from such auxiliary agents. 3 In the case of liability under paragraph 2, recourse is reserved against persons who have handled such organisms improperly or have otherwise contributed to causing or aggravating the loss or damage. 4 If loss or damage is caused by any other pathogenic organisms that are authorised to be put into circulation, the person required to obtain authorisation is liable if the organisms are defective. He is also liable for any defect that he was unable to detect according to the standards of science and technology at the time that the organism was put into circulation. 5 Pathogenic organisms are defective if they do not offer the level of safety that anyone is entitled to expect taking account of all the circumstances; the following must be taken into account in particular: a. the way in which they are presented to the public; b. the use that may reasonably be expected; c. the time at which they were put into circulation. 6 A product containing pathogenic organisms is not defective simply because an improved product has subsequently been put into circulation. 7 The loss or damage must be due to the pathogenicity of the organisms. 8 The burden of proving a causal connection lies with the person claiming damages. If such proof cannot be provided with certainty or if the person subject to the burden cannot reasonably be expected to present the required evidence, the court may satisfy itself on the balance of probability. The court may also order that the facts of the case be established ex officio . 9 The person required to obtain authorisation or file a report must also reimburse the costs of the required and appropriate measures that have been taken to reconstitute elements of the environment that have been destroyed or damaged or to replace such elements with their equivalents. If the destroyed or damaged elements of the environment are not the subject of a property right or if the person entitled does not take the measures required in the circumstances, the right to damages becomes that of the public authority concerned. 10 Any person who proves that the loss or damage was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or of a third party is relieved of liability. 11 Articles 42–47 and 49–53 of the Code of Obligations apply. 12 The Confederation, cantons and communes may also be held liable in accordance with paragraphs 1–11.
