If any strain imposed on the animal cannot be justified by overriding interests, this constitutes a disregard for the animal’s dignity. Strain is deemed to be present in particular if pain, suffering or harm is inflicted on the animal, if it is exposed to anxiety or humiliation, if there is major interference with its appearance or its abilities or if it is excessively instrumentalised; b. well-being : the well-being of animals exists if: 1. husbandry and feeding are such that their bodily functions and their behaviour are not disturbed and excessive demands are not made on their capacity to adapt, 2. species-specific behaviour within the limits of their biological capacity to adapt is guaranteed, 3. they are clinically healthy, 4. pain, suffering, harm and anxiety are avoided; c. animal experiment means any procedure in which a live animal is used with the aim of: 1. testing a scientific hypothesis, 2. observing the effect of a particular procedure in the animal, 3. testing a substance, 4. obtaining or testing cells, organs or bodily fluids, except when this is in the context of agricultural production, diagnostic or curative activities involving the animal or to determine the health status of animal populations, 5. obtaining or replicating organisms alien to the species in question, 6. teaching or training."
