At the request of the executive authority, it may extend a prohibition order that is limited in time in terms of paragraph 2 by a maximum of five years on any one occasion if this is deemed necessary to prevent the offender from committing further felonies and misdemeanours of the type that led to the prohibition order. 3 If a person receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure under Articles 59–61, 63 or 64 for any of the following offences, the court shall prohibit that person for the rest of their life from carrying on any professional activity or organised non-professional activity that involves regular contact with any minors: a. trafficking in human beings (Art. 182) where the offence was committed for the purpose of the sexual exploitation of a minor; b. sexual acts with children (Art. 187), sexual acts with dependent persons (Art. 188) or sexual acts with minors against payment (Art. 196); c. sexual abuse and indecent assault (Art. 189), rape (Art. 190), abuse of a person incapable of proper judgement or resistance (Art. 191), exploitation of a person in a position of need or dependency (Art. 193), deception as to the sexual character of an act (Art. 193 a ), indecent exposure (Art. 194), encouraging prostitution (Art. 195), unauthorised passing on of private sexual content (Art. 197 a ) or sexual harassment (Art. 198), where the offence is committed against or in front of a minor; d. pornography (Art. 197): 1. under Article 197 paragraph 1 or 3, 2. under Article 197 paragraph 4 or 5, where the content of the items or recordings involved sexual acts with minors. 4 If a person receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure under Articles 59–61, 63 or 64 for any of the following offences, the court shall prohibit them from carrying on any professional activity or organised non-professional activity that involves regular contact with especially vulnerable adult persons, as well as any professional activity or organised non-professional activity in the health sector that involves direct contact with patients: a. trafficking in human beings (Art. 182) where the offence was committed for the purpose of the sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and indecent assault (Art. 189), rape (Art. 190), sexual acts with persons incapable of proper judgement or resistance (Art. 191), exploitation of a person in a position of need or dependency (Art. 193), deception as to the sexual character of an act (Art. 193 a ), indecent exposure (Art. 194), encouraging prostitution (Art. 195), unauthorised passing on of private sexual content (Art. 197 a ) or sexual harassment (Art. 198), where the offence is committed against or in front of: 1. an especially vulnerable adult victim, or 2. an adult victim who is not especially vulnerable, but who was incapable of resistance or of judgement or who was unable to defend him- or herself as a result of physical or psychological dependence; b. pornography (Art. 197 para. 2 first sentence and para. 4 or 5), where the items or recordings had the following content: 1. sexual acts with especially vulnerable adult victims, or 2. sexual acts with adult victims who are not especially vulnerable, but who were incapable of resistance or of judgement or who were unable to defend themselves as a result of physical or psychological dependence. 4bis By way of exception, the court may choose not to impose a prohibition order under paragraph 3 or 4 in particularly minor cases if a prohibition order of this type does not appear necessary to prevent the offender from committing further offences of the same type. A prohibition order is however mandatory if the offender: a. has been convicted of trafficking in human beings (Art. 182), indecent assault (Art. 189 paras 2 and 3), rape (Art. 190 paras 2 and 3), sexual acts with persons incapable of proper judgement or resistance (Art. 191) or encouraging prostitution (Art. 195); or b. is a paedophile in accordance with the internationally recognised classification criteria. 5 If the offender receives a sentence or is made subject to a measure for two or more offences in the same proceedings, the court shall specify what portion of the sentence or which measure applies to an offence that entails an activity prohibition order. This portion of the sentence, the measure and the offence are decisive in determining whether an activity prohibition order under paragraph 1, 2, 2 bis , 3 or 4 is imposed. The sentence portions for two or more relevant offences are added together. More than one activity prohibition order may be imposed. 6 The court may order probation assistance for the duration of the prohibition orders. 7 … Amended by No I 1 of the FA of 13 Dec. 2013 on Activity Prohibition Orders and Contact Prohibition and Exclusion Orders, in force since 1 Jan. 2015 ( AS 2014 2055 ; BBl 2012 8819 ).

In such cases, the undertaking shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 5 million francs. 2 If the offence committed falls under Articles 260 ter , 260 quinquies , 305 bis , 322 ter , 322 quinquies , 322 septies paragraph 1 or 322 octies , the undertaking is penalised irrespective of the criminal liability of any natural persons, provided the undertaking has failed to take all the reasonable organisational measures that are required in order to prevent such an offence. 3 The court assesses the fine in particular in accordance with the seriousness of the offence, the seriousness of the organisational inadequacies and of the loss or damage caused and based on the economic ability of the undertaking to pay the fine. 4 Undertakings within the meaning of this title are: a. any legal entity under private law; b. any legal entity under public law with exception of local authorities; c. companies; d. sole proprietorships.

Articles 106 and 107 apply. Article 8 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law is reserved. An offence is also a contravention if, in terms of another Federal Act that came into force before 1942, it carries a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months. 4 Sentences of lengths differing from those mentioned in paragraph 2 and Article 41 as well as fines of amounts differing from those mentioned in Article 106 are reserved. 5 If another federal act provides for a fine to be imposed for a felony or misdemeanour, Article 34 applies. Rules on determining a penalty that differ from Article 34 do not apply. Article 8 of the Federal Act of 22 March 1974 on Administrative Criminal Law remains reserved. If the fine is limited to a sum under 1 080 000 francs, this limit no longer applies. If the fine is limited to a sum exceeding 1 080 000 francs, this limit continues to apply. In this case, the maximum number of daily penalty units equals the current maximum fine divided by 3000. 6 … 6bis If an offence carries a custodial sentence or a monetary penalty with a minimum number of daily penalty units, the lower limit also applies to the minimum number of days in custody. 7 The contraventions provided for in other federal acts are offences, even if they have been committed through negligence, unless only intentional commission is an offence in terms of the provision concerned.
