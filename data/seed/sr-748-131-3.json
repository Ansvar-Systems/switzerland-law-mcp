In this case, the following applies: a. The difference in return must be demonstrated in detail and confirmed by a government-supervised auditing company as defined in Article 7 of the Audit Supervision Act of 16 December 2005. b. The FOCA may approve financing of up to 50% of the difference in return. c.
