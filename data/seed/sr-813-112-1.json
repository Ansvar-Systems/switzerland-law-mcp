In the case of countries that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the notification authority may request other documents that it considers necessary to evaluate compliance with the principles of GLP. 3 If justified by the circumstances, and in particular if the results of the study are very important, or if there is doubt whether the principles of GLP have been respected, a federal executive authority may ask the notification authority to have a study audit carried out."
