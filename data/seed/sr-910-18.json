German: biologisch, ökologisch; b. French: biologique; c. Italian: biologico; d. Romansh: biologic. 3 The Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER) may prescribe a mark which can be used voluntarily for the labelling of products which comply with the provisions of this Ordinance. It may prescribe a special mark for products which are produced in Switzerland. 4 Labelling, advertising material or commercial documents for products which have not been produced in accordance with this Ordinance may not suggest that such products have been produced organically unless such indications do not relate to the agricultural products in the foodstuffs or feedingstuffs or clearly have no connection with the method of production. 5 The labelling may only be used if compliance with the requirements for production, preparation, import, export, storage and marketing of the products has been certified. 5bis The following do not require certification: a. the preparation of products of organic origin at the point of sale, provided that no comparable conventionally-prepared products are prepared in the same production unit and the prepared products are delivered to the consumers solely at the point of sale; b. the preparation of foodstuffs and dishes in restaurant and catering facilities; c. the storage and marketing of products packaged ready for sale and labelled which are intended solely for Switzerland, provided they do not undergo further preparation before delivery to consumers; d. the preparation of certified semi-finished products at the point of sale, provided that no further ingredients are required; e. the portioning of openly sold foodstuffs in front of the customer; f. the slaughter of animals in slaughterhouses; g. internal trade with animals of the bovine species. 6 Trade marks with indications in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 may only be used if the product was produced in accordance with this Ordinance.

Purchases must be from organically produced crops and if possible from the same region. For the purposes of harmonisation with the relevant EU legislation, the Department may make provision that a limited percentage of non-organic animal feedingstuffs may be purchased. 5 The addition of feedingstuffs from conversion holdings is permitted on average up to a maximum of 30 per cent of the ration of individual categories of production animal, as dry matter. If this feedingstuff is from the holding itself, the amount may be 60 per cent, and, where this is a conversion holding, 100 per cent. 6 In case of proven fodder yield losses, especially due to exceptional weather conditions, the directly affected livestock farmer may use non-organic fodder for a limited period with the prior written agreement of the certification body, provided that the livestock farmer is able to satisfy the certification body that insufficient organic fodder is available. If whole areas are affected by fodder yield losses, FOAG may also grant permission for the area. 7 Fodder ingredients must be left natural and fodder preparation methods used must be as natural and energy-saving as possible. Feedingstuffs may not contain any traces of genetically modified organisms or of secondary products of genetically modified organisms which proportionally are higher than the maximum levels for unavoidable impurities laid down in legislation on feedingstuffs. 8 Animals in nomadic herds and animals put out to summer pasture may temporarily graze on non-organically farmed areas. The amount of fodder consumed, as dry matter, may not exceed 10 per cent of the total annual fodder intake. 9 The proportion of non-organically grown fodder may amount to 10 per cent of the total fodder consumption for retired horses.
