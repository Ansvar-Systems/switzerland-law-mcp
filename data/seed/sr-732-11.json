This applies especially to the areas of planning, manufacture, testing, operation, surveillance, maintenance, quality assurance, evaluation of operational experience feedback, ergonomic design as well as basic and advanced training and professional development. b. Any deviations from normal operation should be countered as far as possible by ensuring that the behaviour of the installation is self-regulating and fault-tolerant. Wherever possible, the behaviour of the installation must be inherently safe. The term «inherently safe» is understood to mean that a given system functions safely on its own, i.e. without the support of auxiliary systems. c. In order to deal with accidents, the installation must be designed in such a manner as to ensure that the surroundings are not exposed to impermissible radiological effects. For this purpose, the installation must be equipped with both passive and active safety systems. d. Additional technical, organisational and administrative measures must be taken to prevent and mitigate the consequences if harmful quantities of radioactive substances might be released in case of an accident"

      "title": "Requirements concerning measures to prevent accidents",
      "content": "1 Preventive and protective measures must be taken to avoid accidents in nuclear installations that may originate either within (internal) or outside (external) the installation. 2 Internal initiating events include reactivity disturbance, loss of coolant, loss of heat sink, fire, flooding, mechanical damage due to component failure, damage to cladding when handling fuel elements, failure of operating systems, unintentional activation or faulty functioning of safety systems, and mistakes made by personnel. 3 External initiating events include earthquake, flooding, accidental crash of civil or military aircraft, squall, lightning strike, shock wave, fire, loss of off-site power, impairment or loss of external cooling water supply. 4 For the design of a nuclear installation in accordance with Article 7 letter c, accidents within the meaning of paragraph 2 and accidents not triggered by natural events within the meaning of paragraph 3 must be classified by the frequency specified in Article 123 paragraph 2 RPO. In addition to the initiating event, an unrelated single failure must also be assumed. Proof must be provided that the requirements relating to maximum radiation doses in accordance with Article 123 paragraph 2 RPO are met. 4bis For the design of a nuclear installation in accordance with Article 7 letter c, in the case of accidents triggered by natural events in accordance with paragraph 3, the assumption shall be made of a natural event with a frequency of 10 ‑3 per year and a natural event with a frequency of 10 ‑4 per year. In addition to a natural event triggering the accident, a separate individual error shall be assumed. It must be demonstrated that the dose resulting from a single such event for members of the public: a. is no greater than 1 mSv in the case of a frequency of 10 -3 per year; b. is no greater than 100 mSv in the case of a frequency of 10 -4 per year. 5 Proof must be provided by probabilistic analysis that there is adequate protection against beyond-design-basis accidents. For this purpose, the preventive and mitigating measures in accordance with Article 7 letter d may be taken into account. 6 The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (the Department) shall define the hazard assumptions and associated evaluation criteria in an ordinance.

      "title": "Basic principles for the design of nuclear power plants",
      "content": "1 The following principles apply to nuclear power plants: a. Safety functions must also remain effective even if a single failure occurs independently of an initiating event, and also if a component is not available due to maintenance or repair. Such separate single failures include the random failure of a component that results in its incapacity to perform its intended safety function. Subsequent failures arising from such random failures are also regarded as part of the original single failure. b. Wherever possible, safety functions must be implemented in accordance with the principles of redundancy and diversity. Redundancy refers to the existence of a larger number of functional devices than are required for fulfilling the intended safety function. Diversity refers to the use of different types of physical or technical principles. c. Redundant trains of safety systems installed for performing safety functions must as far as possible be independent of one another in terms of function and in terms of both mechanical and support systems such as instrumentation and control and provision of energy, cooling and ventilation. d. Each redundant train of a safety system installed for performing a safety function must as far as possible be spatially separated from the other trains. e. Redundant devices installed for performing safety functions must be testable, as far as possible in their entirety, or otherwise subdivided into the broadest possible subparts, both manually and through simulated automatic activation, including under emergency power supply. f. Safety functions must be automated so that, in the event of accidents in accordance with Article 8, no interventions important to safety by personnel are required during the first 30 minutes following the initiating event. g. The design of systems and components must take sufficient account of appropriate safety margins. h. As far as possible, systems should be designed to ensure safety-oriented system behaviour in the event of equipment failures. i. Preference must be given to passive rather than active safety functions. j. Work stations and processes for the operation and maintenance of the installation must be designed so that they take account of human capabilities and their limits. k. While ensuring the same degree of safety, preference must be given to measures to prevent accidents in accordance with Article 7 letter d over measures to mitigate their consequences. 2 ENSI shall specify detailed design principles for light-water reactors in guidelines.
