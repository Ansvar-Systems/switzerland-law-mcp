If a commissioner has been appointed, he must be invited to submit a report. 4 After the deadline has expired, the composition court shall issue its decision. This is subject to the same appellate remedies as the emergency moratorium and public notice thereof must be given in the same way. 5 The supreme cantonal composition court shall decide on the basis of the files."
